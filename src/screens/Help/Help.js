					any one of your songs! Start by typing the name and artist
					of your song at the top of the page. In the options dropdown
					menu in the navigation bar, selecting&nbsp;

					the lyrics of the song and artist you've inputted. The
					fetched lyrics will appear in the&nbsp;
					<span className={ui.italic}>Pulled Lyrics</span> section of the
					page. If the lyrics of your song cannot be fetched, another

					<span className={ui.italic}>Pulled Lyrics</span> section of the
					page.

					By default, you will be in regular mode. To switch, press
					the copy button on the leftâ€”the second icon down. Here, you
					can quickly manipulate chords by copying or deleting. To
					select a chord to manipulate, simply click on its box. To
					select a sequence of inputs, click on an input to denote the
					starting point (highlighted in dark red), then press on the
					end input box while holding the ALT (on Windows) or OPTION
					key (on Mac). The toolbar can be found at the bottom of the
					page. To delete, simply choose the EMPTY option. To copy,
					choose the COPY or COPY UNTIL END option. Then, select the
					first of the destination inputs that will receive the copied
					chords. For example, if you select inputs 1 to 3, select
					COPY, then click the fourth input, the contents of inputs 1
					to 3 will be copied to inpus 4 to 6. Lastly, the CLEAR
					option will deselect all chord boxes.

					cursor back four spaces, and enter will save the changes
					you've made.
